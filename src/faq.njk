      <summary class="faq__question">Can I run macOS apps on ravynOS?</summary>
      <div class="faq__answer">
        <p>No - not yet. This is a major goal and we're working towards it. So far, some trivial "Hello World" binaries in C and Objective-C have been compiled on macOS Big Sur and the resulting Mach-O binaries ran on ravynOS using our in-dev Hybrid linker without any Frameworks or tools from macOS. Source code of some simple Cocoa AppKit-based applications have been built on ravynOS and run as native applications (e.g. <code>Install ravynOS.app</code>). While this is all very exciting, you will have to wait a bit longer to run Photoshop or Xcode.</p>

      <summary class="faq__question">Is this... legally sketchy?</summary>
      <div class="faq__answer">
        <p>
            No. Consider projects like ReactOS, a from-scratch effort to create an OS compatible with Microsoft Windows, GNUstep, which provides an open implementation of Cocoa APIs and other things, or Darling, a compatibility layer for running Darwin (macOS) binaries on Linux. ravynOS is similar and stands on the shoulders of many such projects.

        <p>
            All code used is freely available under open source licenses. No proprietary elements like fonts, icons, trademarks, etc can be used. Original code must be written using "clean room" techniques - that is, from public documentation like developer guides by people who have never seen the proprietary code - and released under the FreeBSD license or the MIT license.

      <summary class="faq__question">What programming languages does ravynOS use?</summary>
      <div class="faq__answer">
        <p>
            The goal is to use a small core set of languages as much as possible: the "C" family (C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++), Swift, Python, Java, and shell scripts. This should cover most needs.

      <div class="faq__answer">
        <p>
            Yes. <em>Here's to the crazy ones... because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that do.</em>

            In all seriousness, though, it's not my first rodeo. I have no illusions about the scale of building an OS or how long projects like Haiku, ReactOS or GNUStep took to get usable. This is just something I like doing in my Copious Spare Time&trade; and that I hope will be useful someday.

            I've always liked Apple's design and elegance, but am not thrilled with the direction of recent macOS&reg; or how closed the hardware has become. And I'm a big believer in open source. So ... let's build something that feels as elegant, without all the lock-in, and maybe (just maybe) I can get it to a point that reasonably useful Mac apps build & run on it. And if not, we'll build a lot of cool pieces along the way and learn a ton. I'm OK with that.
