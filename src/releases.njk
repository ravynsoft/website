<h1>Release notes</h1>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/releases/tag/0.3.0pre">0.3.0pre (Tanuki)</a></h2>
<p><strong><em>This is an early Developer Preview release.</em></strong></p>
<p><b>Tanuki</b> is the next iteration of Airyx. Major changes include:
        <ul>
                <li>A new Airyx package repo which gets everything out of /usr/local. Nearly 1000 packages have been built with consistent paths like /System/Library/Fonts, /usr/lib and /etc.</li>
                <li>A LaunchServices framework</li>
                <li>Updated Filer integrated with LaunchServices and
                        built as a real .app bundle in <code>/System/Library/CoreServices/Filer.app</code>. It has also been enhanced
                        to properly extract icons and display names from .app bundles and AppDirs.
                </li>
                <li>A new desktop environment based on KWin and parts of KDE Plasma</li>
                <li>A "system" menu i.e. the persistent icon at the left of the global menu which provides global
                        services like "About" and "System preferences"
                </li>
                <li>A <code>Terminal.app</code>, <code>Firefox.app</code>, and <code>Kate.app</code> (text editor)</li>
                <li>A faster LiveCD boot that uses unionfs and does not require a ramdisk</li>
                <li>Many bugs fixed.</li>
                <li>Many new bugs :)</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Current Status (2021-10-16) - 0.3.0pre3</h2>
<p>
        0.3.0pre gives a glimpse of the upcoming 'Tanuki' release which replaces the 'Atomic'
        proof-of-concept release. With the pre3 release, it is close to being usable for daily
        development and general user tasks.
</p>
<p><b>Firefox</b> and the <b>Kate</b> editor have been added in <code>/Applications</code></p>
<p>Improvements were made to AppKit's window resizing and rendering</p>
<p>The OpenJDK 17 Java development kit has been added in <code>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines</code>.
Java is not integrated with the global menus yet and has some rendering issues, but seems usable for
early testing</p>
<p>The 'application' menu is now bolded in airyxOS-compliant app bundles.</p>
<p>A new installer written in Cocoa has been started, and some fixes were made to the legacy installer
<code>Install FreeBSD.app</code></p>
<p>LaunchServices was improved to fall back to conforming UTIs if an opener app is not found for the
specific file type. (e.g. when opening <code>public.c-source</code>, it will also try <code>public.source-code</code>,
<code>public.plain-text</code> and so on until it finds an app to open the file or reaches the root types.)
<p>The airyxOS tree icon was updated to match the product palm tree logo</p>
<p>A deadlock was fixed in LaunchServices</p>
<p><code>NSString_defaultEncoding</code> no longer corrupts the <code>LANG</code> environment variable</p>
<p><code>konsole</code> was removed, but is still available from the package repo</p>
<p>The default KDE application menu bar has been changed to be more Mac-like</p>
<p>A new EFI boot logo was added and some branding was updated</p>
<p>
        The new LiveCD boot and package repo are implemented. Packages can only be installed from the
        Airyx repo at the moment, which does not have much beyond the essential system packages. It is possible
        to add the FreeBSD repo, but this may result in unwanted duplicate packages being installed in /usr/local
        and could break the system. The long-term plan is to package most software as bundles and AppDirs, and
        possibly to port Homebrew as an alternative package system.
</p>
<p>A mostly complete LaunchServices framework is available, providing the <code>LS</code>
        and <code>UTType</code> APIs.
</p>
<p>
        Filer has been repackaged into <code>/System/Library/CoreServices/Filer.app</code>
        and modified to work with
        LaunchServices. It is not very useful yet since the LS database is minimal and there are few apps
        installed to open files. As it discovers .app bundles or AppDirs (i.e. you browse to their parent folder),
        the apps are added to the LaunchServices database.
</p>
<p>There is a <a href="/images/airyx_0.3pre_splash.png">cute new splash screen</a> after login :)</p>
<p>
        The desktop environment has been rebased onto a "minimal" KDE Plasma 5. KWin provides window management and plasmashell provides the top menu bar. This gives us the power of KDE's KF5 frameworks (not to be confused with Framework bundles) and services for implementing a powerful, smooth, and integrated desktop experience. You can run a command by invoking KRunner with Alt-Shift-F2 or Option-Shift-F2. Try running <code>konsole</code>.
</p>
<p>An 'Airyx' menu has been added and the enabled items all work. Notably, choosing <em>System Preferences</em>
        will invoke the KDE System Preferences panel until a more Mac-like panel can be implemented. Please try the
        <em>About This Computer</em> and report any issues with identifying your hardware.
</p>
<p>'Exposé' also works - move your mouse to the top left corner.</p>
<p>GUI elements and menu bar layout are now closer to a Catalina or Big Sur look</p>
<p>Some system wallpapers have been added in <code>/System/Library/Desktop Pictures</code></p>
<p>Rust has been patched to support frameworks (untested)</p>
<p>XDG directories are now in <code>~/Library/FreeDesktop</code></p>
<p>Updated to Python 3.8 + many other package updates</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/mszoek/airyx/releases/tag/v0.2.2">0.2.2 (Atomic)</a></h2>
<p><strong><em>This is a Developer Preview release.</em></strong></p>
<p>
        0.2.2 is the first build of Airyx based on the <a href="https://hellosystem.github.io/docs/">helloSystem</a> components
        and FuryBSD LiveCD installer. It introduced <code>DBusKit</code> with preliminary support for
        exporting NSMenus to the global menu bar over DBus and installs to a ZFS root.
</p>
<p>
        The Atomic series is built with standard FreeBSD packages in /usr/local and was slow to boot the LiveCD
        due to its need to copy the image to a ramdisk. These issues have been fixed for 0.3.0 (Tanuki).
